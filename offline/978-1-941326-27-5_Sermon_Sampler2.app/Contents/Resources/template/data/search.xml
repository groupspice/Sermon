        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTWelcome to the Deepening Life Together study on the Sermon on the Mount. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of commitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5Session OutlineMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overempha- size one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship.Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, minis- try, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstMemory VersesFor each session we have provided a Memory Verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities.You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker question, and/or you can check in with one or two group members— your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encourage- ment in your spiritual journey.DVD Teaching SegmentA Deepening Life Together: Sermon on the Mount Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Greg Sidders. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section).GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstDEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.SHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstFor Deeper Study (optional)Some sessions provide For Deeper Study. If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more bib- lical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide you with plenty to discuss within the group. These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group. You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.12]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONIn 2004, a massive earthquake measuring over 9.0 on the Richter scale occurred under the Indian Ocean just o  the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Within hours of the earthquake, 50-foot killer tsunami waves slammed into coastlines, snatching people out to sea, drown- ing others in their homes or on beaches, and demolishing property. The tsunamis generated by the earthquake killed over 150,000 people in 14 countries—Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, and Yemen.Tsunamis occur when violent movements of the Earth’s under- sea tectonic plates displace an enormous amount of water, send- ing powerful waves in every direction. The waves travel as fast as 450 miles per hour from the area of the disturbance, much like the ripples that happen after throwing a rock into a pool of water. As the large waves approach shallow waters along the coast, they grow to as high as 100 feet.The West Coast of the United States gets damaging tsunamis about every 18 years. Hawaii experiences damage from tsunamis about every 7 years. To protect themselves and their homes from the massive destruction caused by tsunamis, the Tsunami Warning Centers in Honolulu, Hawaii, and Palmer, Alaska, were created to monitor disturbances that might trigger a tsunami. When a tsunami is detected, the center tracks it and issues warnings when needed.13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[IntroductionBefore this warning system was in place, many people lost their lives and/or livelihood to the devastating e ects of the tsunami. Now, people in this region of the world have time to prepare and evacuate to safety.Just as the tsunami warning system enables people to prepare for what is coming, John the Baptist came to prepare the hearts and minds of the people for what is to come for eternity—the kingdom of heaven. John prepared the way for Jesus Christ, in whom God came to earth and began the establishment of his kingdom on earth. Like the consequences of being unprepared for an approaching tsunami or other natural disaster, we will each face very serious consequences if we do not prepare ourselves for God’s kingdom. The Bible tells us how to do this.During the next six weeks, we will discover what it means to be members of the kingdom as we examine the powerful teaching Jesus delivered in the  rst of his great sermons—the Sermon on the Mount. In this sermon, Jesus establishes the way by which the citizens of God’s kingdom shall live.Jesus’s teaching shows that God’s standard for ethical living is so high that its demands can’t be met without God working inside us, transforming and empowering us at the heart level. Unlike the Mosaic system of sacri ces for atonement of sin, which called for ritualistic conformity to the Law, Jesus calls for inward heart trans- formation. His teaching should not seem like a burden but should drive us to complete dependence upon God.This sermon leaves no doubt in the minds of its hearers that sal- vation cannot be earned by human merit but is given freely through the bountiful divine grace of God upon hearts that are yielded fully to him. Once our hearts are yielded to him, we shall see the trans- formation of our outward behavior as well.14]]></text>

Blessed are they who keep his statutes and seek him with alltheir heart (Ps. 119:1–2).In 2004, James and his family seemed to have it all: a multimillion- dollar home with high-tech toys, a swimming pool, a tennis court, and a four-car garage  lled with SUVs. James, a successful business- man, spent the previous four years building a lucrative computer business that supported over 285 employees.After being featured on the cover of a popular international in- dustry magazine as the number one fastest growing  rm, James became a target for greedy businessmen who coveted his success and acquired wealth. Consequently, the years that followed were riddled with false accusations, lawsuits, and anxiety. By 2006, James had lost it all—or so it seemed to the outside world.To settle the lawsuits, James gave away the company, millions of dollars, and sold whatever toys that remained. For the  rst time he was poor. It was during a lunch meeting with two Christian busi- nessmen that James rededicated his life to the Lord.15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Sermon on the MountStarting over, James began to build a consulting  rm founded on biblical principles. His focus switched from acquiring wealth to building up people. Since then, James has successfully coached over 300 companies to grow their business with a variety of coaching programsthroughaccountability,encouragement,andintegrity.His guiding verse is Philippians 4:4: “Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!”During a recent national coaching seminar, James stated, “It was when I was content to give it all away that God truly enriched my life.” During this session we will discuss how the Beatitudes turn the world’s values upside down. We will explore and understand how God truly wants to bless and enhance our lives, and how these bless-ings can help us become people who change the world.CONNECTING 10 min.Begin your group time with prayer. Ask God for willing hearts to receive his Word through this Bible study and for the courage to change as he challenges you in the weeks to come.Deeper relationships happen when we take time to keep in touch with one another. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets to you, write down your contact information, including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone volunteer to make cop- ies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, what you do for fun, and any- thing else you would like to share.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your group values. In the Appendix is a Small Group Agreement with values most useful in sustain- ing healthy, balanced groups. Review these values and choose one or two—values you haven’t previously focused on or have16]]></text>

Matthew 5:6 says: “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.” Righteousness means “right standing with God.” Based on the words of Jesus in the Beatitudes, what do you think hungering and thirsting for righteousness should look like in a Christian’s life?9. What substitutions do Christians tend to hunger for instead of righteousness?How can we overcome our hunger for these substitutes? (See 1 John 5:3–4 for insight.)10. What do you think Jesus means by peacemakers in verse 9?11. We are aliens in this world and will su er persecution for stand- ing up for God’s standards of righteousness. What forms does this persecution take in our day-to-day lives?What can help you persevere when this happens?12. What have you learned about your own attitudes during this session?What has God revealed to you?13. Jesus tells us that living the Beatitudes will enable us to be salt and light (vv. 13–16), the transforming presence of God in the world today. What do you think it means to be salt and light? (See the Study Notes for information about salt and light.)How can living out these attitudes and actions help us to be- come salt and light?The Beatitudes turn the world’s values upside down and o er a vivid picture of true life in Christ. Ful llment comes not through control, social status, possessions, or pleasure, but from purity of heart, a righteousness that can only be attained through faith in Jesus Christ, love, integrity, and hope in our consummation in God’s19]]></text>

As we live out our transformation, we are provided un- limited access to God’s bountiful grace that enables us to bring transformation to the lives of others—becoming kingdom-minded people who change the world.DEVELOPING 10 min.Kingdom-minded people who change the world do so through special gifts God has given us to use as the Holy Spirit leads. The  rst step in developing the gifts that God has given each of us is to deepen our relationship with him through prayer, re ection, and medita- tion on his Word.14. Developing our ability to serve God as the Holy Spirit leads requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to connecting with God daily through per- sonal prayer. It’s important to separate yourself from the distractions in your life so you can really focus on commu- nicating with God. Some people  nd it helpful to write out their prayers in a journal.t Re ection. At the end of each session you’ll  nd Re ections Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study for the session. These are provided to give you an opportunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Psalm 119:11 says: “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.” Meditation is focused attention on the Word of God and is a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. One way to do this is to write a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere where you’re sure to see it often, such as your bathroom mirror, car’s dashboard, or the kitchen table. Think about20]]></text>

Re ect on what God is saying to you through his words. Consider using the pas- sages provided in the Re ections pages in each session. As you meditate upon these Scriptures, you will notice them beginning to take up residence in your heart and mind.SHARING 10 min.Jesus lived and died so that humankind might come to know him and be reconciled to God through him. Through his Holy Spirit, we are empowered to be his witnesses to the people around us.15. Jesus wants all of his disciples to help others connect with him, to know him personally. When we live out the Beatitudes, we become like salt and light in the world (Matt. 5:13–16), transforming it with God’s presence. How can focusing on the blessings Jesus talks about in the Beatitudes encourage us as we strive to be salt and light in the world?16. In the weeks to come, you’ll be asked to identify and share with people in your circle of in uence who need to know Jesus or need to connect with him through a small group community. With this in mind, as you go about your day-to-day activities this week, pay special attention to the people God has placed in your life. There may be co-workers, family or friends, other parents at school or sporting events that you see or talk to on a regular basis. When we meet next time, we’ll talk about how to help connect believers to Christian community and begin sharing Jesus with those who don’t yet know him.SURRENDERING 10 min.Jeremiah 29:13 says, “You will seek me and  nd me when you seek me with all your heart.” God promises to be there for us when we yield our hearts fully to him. Each week you will have a chance to surrender your hearts to God in worship and prayer.21]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Sermon on the Mount17. Consider some di erent ways to worship that might  t your group. Following are a few ideas. Spend a few minutes wor- shiping God together.t Have someone use their musical gifts to lead the group in a worship song. You might sing a simple chorus a cappella, with guitar/piano accompaniment, or with a worship CD.t Read a passage of Scripture aloud together, making it a time of praise and worship as the words remind you of all God has done for you. Choose a psalm or other favorite verses.t Spend a few minutes praising God aloud. You may highlight some of the attributes of God’s character or praise him for speci c circumstances in your life.18. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is personal and re ects who you are in relationship with him. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture. Re ections are provided at the end of each session for you to use as part of your daily time with God. These will o er reinforcement of the principles you are learning, and develop or strengthen your habit of time alone with God throughout the week.19. Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week. Close in prayer asking God to encourage each participant to embrace the Beatitudes and begin to live them out daily.Study NotesKingdom of heaven: God’s people and the realm in which God reigns as King and his will is done. In the Sermon on the Mount, the King22]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[People Who Change the Worldexplains how citizens of his kingdom will live. “Kingdom of heaven” is a Jewish equivalent of “kingdom of God.” Jews avoided saying God’s name, so “heaven” became a way of referring to God. Mat- thew usually uses “kingdom of heaven,” while Mark and Luke speak of the “kingdom of God.”Salt: Salt is used as a preservative and  avor enhancer. As a preser- vative, it hinders the spread of evil. As a  avor enhancer, it makes living in this world more palatable. The salt of the Dead Sea region was full of impurities and would often lose its  avor and e ective- ness as a preservative.Light: Light shines in stark contrast to the darkness. Followers of Christ are to be light, to stand out as positive witnesses, clearly vis- ible in the dark world.For Deeper Study (Optional)In Luke 6:20–26, we  nd teaching by Jesus that parallels Matthew’s Beatitudes and includes a point-by-point counterpart to each bless- ing. Read Luke 6:24–26. “But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort. Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets.”1. Why do you think woes come upon those who are rich, well- fed, happy, and popular in life?2. How does this further illustrate the truth that Christ’s follow- ers are blessed if we are kingdom-minded?23]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSWhat do we do on the  rst night of our group?Like all fun things in life—have a party! A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a few people or for existing groups that lose a few people along the way. Pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another strategy is to ask church leaders to announce that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months, but every other week can work as well. We recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting, they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch75]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked Questionsrelationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direc- tion, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have some- thing to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will mature and members will share the facilitation of meetings. Healthy groups share hosting and leading. This ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.How do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. Try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can watch the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their young children all evening. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the adults who provide a lesson or care for thechildreneitherinthesamehomeorinanotherhomenearby.This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. Whatever the decision, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.76]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One People Who Change the WorldConnecting1. Allow each participant to introduce themselves to the group. Whether your group is new or ongoing, there may be new people in the group who don’t yet have an established relationship with the group. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.As part of this discussion, we recommend talking about shared owner- ship of the group. It’s important that each member have a role. See Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.Also, you will  nd a Small Group Calendar in the Appendix for use in planning your group meetings and roles. Take a look at the calendar prior to your  rst meeting and point it out to the group so that each person can note when and where the group will meet, who will bring snacks, any im- portant upcoming events (birthdays, anniversaries), etc.3. Ask for volunteers to answer the introductory question after the group members have had an opportunity to introduce themselves and review the Small Group Agreement.107LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Blessed are . . .The poor in spirit(v. 3)Those who mourn(v. 4)The meek (v. 5)Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness (v. 6)The merciful (v. 7)The pure in heart(v. 8)The peacemakers (v. 9)How does this apply to our lives?How do we fall short?Leader’s NotesGrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. The word “blessed” in the context of Matthew 5:3–11 means “happy or privileged” and conveys the idea of being especially favored by God. Jesus makes a clear delineation between worldly happiness and the blessedness of God’s kingdom in his use of paradox. Worldly happiness is not found in poverty, humility, and self-sacri ce, but in perceived wealth, vanity, and abundance, which are temporary and ultimately prove empty.5. See the chart below.Deep humility. Awareness of spiritual bankruptcy, of having no resources for self-help.We try to be self-su cient, not trusting God with everything. We are proud.Profound sorrow over sin and loss su ered for the sake of following Jesus.We lack repentance over cer- tain sins in our life. We are self-satis ed and unmoved by our faith.Gentleness and care toward others, as opposed to aggres- sion, domination, or apathy.We behave with aggression toward others, controlling or forceful.Yearning for and seeking God’s standards for right living to prevail in one’s own heart and behavior, in one’s community, and around the globe.We believe we are “good people.” We feel that we’ve got our acts together. We think we are better than oth- ers, especially those who don’t know Jesus.Sharing in the a ictions of others. O ering forgiveness and compassion.We remain unsympathetic to the needs of our neighbors or communities.Honesty with God. At- tention to the motives and desires that drive behavior, rather than simply external conformity.We behave dishonorably. We “hide” our sins from God and others. We behave like Chris- tians at church and not at other times.Promoting peace with God, in personal relationships, and among larger groups of people.We are self-seeking, needing to be right or justi ed in discus- sions. Our relationships are full of strife.108]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesSu ering for standing up for God’s standards of righteousness.We have constantly shifting ideologies.Those per- secuted because of righteousness (vv. 10–11)7. Each of these blessings is an act of God’s divine grace and mercy and can’t be achieved by our own accomplishments. They don’t represent earthly riches or rewards, but spiritual blessings, such as inclusion in the kingdom of heaven and forgiveness of sin. Some of them we receive immediately when we become children of God, but others we have to wait for with patient hope.8. Our hearts’ desire should be righteousness in God’s eyes. This includes all theattitudesrepresentedintheBeatitudes,suchasdeephumility,repentance for our sin, compassion toward others, pure motives, and integrity in all circumstances. Our appetites for righteousness will be  lled only by a daily portion of grace to act according to the will of our Lord.9. Some substitutions are achieving success in the workplace, acquisition of material possessions or wealth, and recreation; always wanting to “be the best” and “have the best” in the eyes of the world.We need the grace of God through the power of the Holy Spirit, and we also need the willingness to submit to that grace. We need to endure the discomfort of facing the things we hunger for and confessing those things to God. Sometimes other people can be very helpful. God wants to help us do what we can’t do on our own.10. The whole Bible is about God’s plan to reconcile us to him—to make our relationships whole again. Jesus is teaching about reconciliation when he says blessed are the peacemakers. We should be about bringing reconcilia- tion, or making peace, between those who are in con ict.11. Possible answers include ridicule for living uprightly, personal attack on political or social ideologies, and rebellion by children who live in opposi- tion to family values.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.14. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word109]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesof God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making time to connect with God a priority in their life. Encourage everyone to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.16. Encourage the group to observe their interactions during the coming week with the intention of using these observations next week in evaluating the people that God has placed in their lives that he might want them to share with or invite to small group.SurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each session will pro- vide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.18. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while re- inforcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.19. As you move to a time of sharing prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that the personal things they share will be kept con dent if you are to have safety and bonding among group members.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in most ses- sions. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study,110]]></text>
